### Hye, ሰላም <a href=""><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>
I'm Henok.

## I am a Fullstack Developer that focuses on front end frameworks such as React and build tools such as Webpack.
I have a passion and diligence for Design Systems, and Data Analytics. I am interested in pursuing Machine
Learning and related roles after graduation.

As a hobbie I love to join hackathons. It's a challenging task that forces me to peel back to all the knowledge I've
gained and put into practice. It forces me to acknowledge my gaps and work on enhancing my skills. For me to
ever master a concept, I have to put it to practice

- 🌱 I’m currently a student
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with others and work on projects
- 🥅 2021 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love muay thai🥋
