Hye, I‚Äôm Henok Fisseha residing in this beautiful world. I am a Software Engineer that focuses on pursuing Machine Learning and full-stack development role. I have a passion and diligence for Software Development, Artificial intelligence, and user experience development.  

As a hobbie I love to join hackathons. It's a challenging task that forces me to peel back to all the knowledge I've
gained and put into practice. It forces me to acknowledge my gaps and work on enhancing my skills. For me to
ever master a concept, I have to put it to practice
